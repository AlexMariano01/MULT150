Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.

I think the game is too easy because the slowing factor can easily be counter acted by just grabbing a speed powerup. On top of this, the number of speed up powerups are too consistent leaving a lot of room for the player to comeback from a bad move.

What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

I would lessen the amount of speed powerups and increase the slow down rate.

List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.

I think adding some models on the sides as well as adding a different mechanic such as upgrades instead of just speed powerups would make the game feel a lot more rewarding.

What 2 parts of the game are fun?

It's a simple game idea which can be fun for a lot of people. There is some replayability to it as well.

What 2 parts of the game are tedious?

The sliding on the floor when the player is moving can be pretty tedious at times. On top of this, the gameplay loop itself is tedious.

Modify the obstacle prefab:

I made the model a different shade of red as I like the red color when it reflects the lights from the powerups.

Modify the powerup prefab:

Added 3D start size to the powerup, as well as changed the color of the particles to a darker shade.
