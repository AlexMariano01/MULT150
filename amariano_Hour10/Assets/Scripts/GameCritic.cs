Is the game too easy or hard?

I would say the game is very easy. For example, sometimes you don't have to do anything but stand there and the balls will go into the goal on their own.

What would make it easier or harder?

Making the game easier would probably involve increasing the size of the bumper, as well as increasing player movement speed. To make the game harder you could make the arena larger or add moving collisions for the player.

What would give it a "wow" factor?

I think in order for the game to achieve the "wow" factor, it would have to have multiple levels with different scenes and be HIGHLY polished.

What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?

The game itself and it's mechanics are fun. Sometimes when you think you have a shot at getting the ball in the goal, the bumper just phases through the ball.

Suggestions I implemented:

I added terrain that borders the arena to create a theme that I thought would fit the game.

I added a play again button.

I added a Start Game button with a title that serves as a main menu. The game stays paused until the start button is pressed.

I added a free background music asset I found through unit's asset store. I thought that it would really make the game feel more alive and it definitely helped in that aspect.
